* Fix drawing code! There's lots of duplication and it's very difficult to follow. Abstract out the "drawing a line along the sector width" code to something more generic/easy to understand.
  * Maybe create an "in-sector" entity class that contains boilerplate rotation/positioning code?
* Better use of constants
